## Motion Manifold Learning from Demonstration (MMLfD) Tutorial

This repository includes codes for generating figures and videos used in YH's tutoral talk on 
**A Geometric Take on Motion Manifold Learning from Demonstration**
at *[Riemann and Gauss meet Asimov: 2nd Tutorial on Geometric Methods in Robot Learning, Optimization and Control in ICRA 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/icra-2024-tutorial-geometry/)*. 

### Trained models

You can download pre-trained models from [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aeHgiGucysqyV9Opx8XQGhm2JLey9FR4?usp=sharing).
